### Visualizing bootstrap results
To investigate which tasks separate algorithms well (i.e., lead to a stable ranking), a blob plot is recommended.

Bootstrap results can be shown in a blob plot showing one plot for each
task. In this view, the spread of the blobs for each algorithm
can be compared across tasks. Deviations from the diagonal indicate deviations
from the consensus ranking (over tasks). Specifically, if rank
distribution of an algorithm is consistently below the diagonal,
the algorithm performed better in this task than on average
across tasks, while if the rank distribution of an algorithm
is consistently above the diagonal, the algorithm performed
worse in this task than on average across tasks. At the bottom
of each panel, ranks for each algorithm in the tasks are provided.


<!-- Shows which subtask leads to stable ranking and in which subtask ranking is more uncertain. -->


Same as in Section \ref{blobByTask} but now ordered according to consensus.
